```
    • Given/Arrange
        — A starting state. This is where you set up data or the
        environment to get ready for the action.
    • When/Act
        — Some action is performed. This is the focus of the test—the
        behavior we are trying to make sure is working right.
    • Then/Assert
        — Some expected result or end state should happen. At the
        end of the test, we make sure the action resulted in the expected behavior.
